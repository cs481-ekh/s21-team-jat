User:	Sara Goltry
Furnace Temp. [ºC]:	425.000000
Notes:	After overnight temp ramp, QCM mass/freq of the new Piezocryst GaPO4 crystal looked VERY stable (fluctuating by only 10 ng/cm2). Current run is 5 min purge, then 50 cycles TMA (1sec/20sec) + H2O (2sec/20sec), 5 min purge, 10 pulses TMA, 5 min purge, 20 cycles TMA+H2O, 10 min purge. Needle valves on TMA/H2O/QCM all the same as previous runs. (TMA needle valve set to 1.00 or 4 rotations, H2O needle valve set to 1.75 or 7 rotations, QCM back purge set to 0.20.)
